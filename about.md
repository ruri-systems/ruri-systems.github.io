Ruri Systems is a one-man consulting company, with primary focus on
_Infrastructure_, whether it be _Cloud_, _on-premise_ or something _hybrid_.

On this blog I plan to put useful articles, mostly related to the main body of
my work, but with possible sidequests into areas such as _programming_
(especially in _Lisp_) or even _Retrocomputing_ (because we need to know the
past to invent the future).

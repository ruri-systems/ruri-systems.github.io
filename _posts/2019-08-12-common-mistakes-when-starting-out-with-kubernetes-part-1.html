<i>Kubernetes. Containers. Orchestration.</i> It’s all the rage currently and it
seems like you have to do it or be forgotten in the dust.  Then one tries and
hits the wall trying to understand how to get going outside of few nice cloud
providers (like GKE), find it hard to move beyond minikube, and generally find
oneself with a lot of problems and little to no benefits expounded by
Kubernetes fans (like me!).  This post is going to be first of a series where I
am going to try and document common mistakes that might be not obvious to
someone just starting out, to make your travels with Kubernetes into smooth
sailing.  
</p>

<h2 id="org8456b4f">Not enough resources</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8456b4f">
<p>
A common complaint I’ve encountered is with regards to how many resources K8s
consumes even before you start your own applications, and how few small VMs
weren’t capable of getting it running because kube-system eats 70% of a node.
</p>

<p>
The reason behind it is that various system components of Kubernetes have
empirically-derived resource requirements - for a reasonably big and active
deployment. Minikube sets its own, much smaller requests on resources for
internal services, and thus can reasonably work on much smaller system.
</p>

<p>
<b>The answer is to use at least 2, preferably more, CPU per node.</b> You can
modify the settings to be workable on lesser resources, but when starting out
it’s not advisable.

<div id="outline-container-org2870a2a" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org2870a2a">Using few big machines instead of many smaller ones</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2870a2a">
<p>
<i>Didn't you just tell us to use a bigger machine?</i>  
</p>

<p>
Why, yes, I did.
</p>

<p>
There are two conflicting forces at play. Each individual node needs to be
powerful enough to run cluster-supporting workloads, as well as reasonable
amount of your own. However simply making few big nodes means that whenever a
node fails, your available capacity drop much more - and that means that the
knock-on effect on the rest of the cluster is much bigger. Even when you plan
your capacity to account for this and use pod antiAffinities and multiple
replicas, even if you run in cloud with autoscaler setting a new node to take
over immediately - the bigger percentage a single node represents, the worse
the chaos after failure.
</p>

<p>
Sounds like simple, obvious thing, yet I have to admit I have done that in the past.
</p>

<p>
A good rule of thumb is that you should try to have nodes sized so that
losing one node doesn't take a significant portion of your capacity offline.
Otherwise you're risking that possibly failing pods won't result in not
enough capacity, as system loses <i>slack</i> necessary to start new resources in
replacement of failing ones.
</p>

<p>
Nature of kubernetes as a much more dynamic system than rigid approaches like
pacemaker and manually allocated applications, while making it easier to use
every last bit of capacity you have, also makes it a bit more chaotic (good
time to get that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_engineering">Chaos Engineering</a> practices in play!).

<h2 id="orge46ed76">Requesting too many resources unknowingly</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge46ed76">
<p>
This is something that has bitten me in the past. You should always, always
specify resource requests (CPU, memory) and limits. Otherwise you might find
yourself in a situation where adding new deployment, despite unloaded
cluster, fails due to&#x2026; missing capacity. This was caused by GKE having (at
least in 2016!) a default <i>limitRange</i> set on <i>default</i> namespace that
automatically set <code>request.cpu=100m</code>. 
</p>

<p>
In my case the cause was historical, default CPU allocation on GKE. But the
crucial part was <i>not knowing it was there</i>. If you have a resource
reservation defined for the namespaces you use and you don't know about it,
it's very easy to quickly find out that your deployments are locked due to
"no capacity" errors.
</p>

<p>
<b>Learn about resource limits, requests, and quotas, and remember to always apply them to your pods.</b>
</p>

<p>
Any pod without explicit resource settings should be done by conscious
decision, otherwise you might be woken by alerts at the most inopportune
moment.

# Ruri Systems is available for contract work

I have worked in the field of linux & networking infrastructure for over 11
years now, working from simple single servers without real management or
strategy, through automated cloud setups to complex customized on-premise
solutions optimized for minimal operations load - including programming-in the
ability for the system to heal with minimal remote hands use.

A good infrastructure can make the difference between painful slog with
increasingly _cranky_ service, annoyed users and burning-out teams, and a well
oiled machine that supports all your efforts, letting you take care of your
goals instead of running to fire with empty buckets - because there was no time to fill them.

I've worked with systems spanning from cookie-cutter linux installs, to 36-bit
computers that predate Unix and use octal as defaults. I've built continuous
integration systems, wrangled problematic software to be testable, fork-lifted
classic webhosting into kubernetes _at lower TCO_. 

These days I concentrate on *Cloud* environments, with focus on *Kubernetes* for
deployments.
